This code uses the smtplib library to send emails via an SMTP server. The send_email function takes in the recipient's email address, subject, and body of the email as inputs and sends the email. The send_subscription_reminder and send_subscription_expiry functions use the send_email function to send emails for subscription renewal reminders and expired subscriptions respectively.

Please note that the code above is just an example and you will need to replace the placeholders (e.g. 'sender_email@example.com', 'smtp.example.com') with your own email address and SMTP server details. Also, please keep in mind that this code may not include all necessary security measures, error handling, and optimization for production use. It is recommended to thoroughly review and test the code before implementing it in a live system.


import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

def send_email(to, subject, body):
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = 'sender_email@example.com'
    msg['To'] = to
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))

    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com', 587)
    server.starttls()
    server.login('sender_email@example.com', 'sender_password')
    server.send_message(msg)
    server.quit()

    subject = 'Subscription Renewal Reminder'
    body = 'Hello, this is a reminder that your subscription will expire soon. Please renew your subscription to continue receiving trading signals.'
    send_email(user_email, subject, body)

def send_subscription_expiry(user_email):
    subject = 'Subscription Expired'
    body = 'Hello, your subscription has expired. Please renew your subscription to continue receiving trading signals.'
    send_email(user_email, subject, body)
